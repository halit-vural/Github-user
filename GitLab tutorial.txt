------  GIT -------
Basic git commands
In Terminal
  git --version
  git init
		new empty repo
  git init repo-name-here
  cd repo-name
  git config --global init.defaultBranch main
		set up default branch
  git branch -m main
  git status
		shows the history
  

''main branch is not used for mid process. it is dangerous. the way is to make a branch for development and do the tests after code. if the tests pass, then you can merge the branch to main. later, you can delete the branch.''

  git add <file-name>
		starts tracking the file for changes. otherwise changes will not be recorded.
		working dir (add)-> staging (commit)-> repository
  git rm --chached <file>...
		unstages the file
  git commit -m "my message about commit"
  git config --global user.name "hvbosna"
		git asks the credential
  git config --global user.email "bosna.halit@gmail.com"
  git log
		list of all commits until now
		(HEAD -> main)  check-out point

Making a separate branch
  git branch <branch-name>
		new branch is added, but we are still in main branch
  git checkout <branch-name>
  git status
		no commits in empty branch
  git log
		HEAD -> <branch>

Merge
  git checkout main
  git merge <source-branch>
  git log --all --oneline
		give all commits
		summarize them in one line each
  git branch -d <branch>

Stash
It works similar to commit but the changes are not seen publicly on the branch. They kept locally.

  git stash push
		the changes are not seen in working directory. they are kept hidden in local
  git stash apply
		it will reapply the changes to working directory
		it will not remove changes from stash
  git stash pop
		it will remove the changes from the list
  git stash list
		shows the change ref in stash
